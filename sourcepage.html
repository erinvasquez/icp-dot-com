                <h2>Developer's Log - August 26th 2022 *** NEW ***</h2>
                <p>I've managed to recreate some more maze C# code in Unity engine in 2022. My OpenXR capabilities have also been revived, and I'll be able to start work on my VR Theremin project soon. Now that Unity and OpenXR's compatibility has been refined a bit more, I'm excited to see create more synthesizers and instruments. I've also managed to start re-doing this site. It should be easier to read and use on all devices.</p>

                <h2>Developer's Log - August 16th 2022</h2>
                <p>More C# code has been committed to GitHub for my synthesizer. I've moved onto testing a console-based C# synthesizer instead of a C# Windows Form application. That repository will be up soon. In other news, I've uploaded a tech demo of my Visualizer work in the Unity 3D Engine. I've also managed to write a bash shell script on this server to update the site from the github repository. A success!</p>

                    I've been reached out to by a friend from University about making a maze for students in a thesis study would play. I recalled working on maze generation algorithms last year and have decided to pull up that old code that can be found on github here: https://github.com/erinvasquez/InvisibleChairProjectHDRP. I'm attempting to fix the maze generation outside of a debug environment, but I've made fantastic progress re-simulating maze generation with the pathing algorihtms I had studied before. Images are uploaded and will be featured in the future in this very blog post. Otherwise, wait for a link to appear below to a gallery of some sorts.

                <p>
                    In the month since starting this quote unquote blog, I've been maintaining some new C# Synthesizer code. With a combination of examples already on the internet in various languages, and a bit of my own
                    musical knowledge, I've translated some C# Physics Engine code for a previous VR Synthesizer/Instrument into a C# Framework Windows Forms application. Pictures and videos of the project will be available soon. I'm extremely excited to see this project grow. It's a great combination of science and music.

                <h2>Developer's Log - July 6th 2022</h2>
                <p>My website is finally up and running again. I plan on adding more logs about my progress in the future. I've managed to save enough funds to run a budget Google Cloud Virtual Machine to run this website. Time to focus energy on sprucing up this website and exploring more C#, ASP.net, JavaScript audio synthesis, and Python machine learning.</p>
