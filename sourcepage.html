                <p>Here you can find everything from business to leisure. I have a variety of skills, and I try my best to put them all to use. Personal projects, like hand-coded VR Instruments, music visualizers, music synthesizers, 3D Models will all be featured on this site in the future. I also expect to showcase orchestral and jazz-themed trombone music in the future on this site. I also VRDJ in my freetime, so expect to catch livestreams or links to any live shows in the future here as well. I hope to one day remix old mexican rancheras and house music, so if anyone has read all the way down to this line, I promise to bring you this one day.</p>

                <h2>Oscillator Project</h2>
                <p>A sin-wave oscillator program that outputs audio signals via the Unity 3D Engine's audio system. With this simple sin-wave oscillator, we can control a variety of factors to control the sound
                we create. Several different waveform types can be used, and can be added or multiplied onto each other, creating unique sound types. At the moment, keyboard input is being rigged via Unity 2020's
                newest Input System. In the future, an entire synthesizer comprised of QWERTY keyboard controls. As an extra effect, I intend to have the on-screen keyboard, as well as the surrounding 3D environment, react to
                the user's input. Either via the key they play, or the timing used in between keystrokes. BPM Detection may be needed to accomplish this.</p>

                <h2>VR Oscillator Project</h2>
                <p>Building on the previously made oscillator, I found that the oscillator's pitch and volume could be manipulated using some simple controls. Height and distance values fed from a pair of Steam VR
                controllers are an incredible way to interact with music using the player's body. Similar to how a trombone player's stretched arm length determines the pitch of the note played on the instrument,
                the distance from the ground determines either pitch or volume. Improvements or even specializations in this design will be considered in creating future VR instruments.</p>

                <h2>Invisible Chair Project</h2>
                <p>An artistic outlet for all of the interesting story telling and adventurous ideas that my brain seems to have picked up on. All of the ideas intended for this project are indeed fantasies, and
                many will either not be made to perfection, or will never be made. No matter how useless these ideas may be, I feel manifesting them into 3D interactive experiences helps practice my problem solving skills,
                and allows me to keep my mind on software with a genuine love and interest. These creations will be made for their own sake, and for their own enjoyment. A hard thing to keep fully intact.</p>
