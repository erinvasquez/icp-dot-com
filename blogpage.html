                <h2>Developer's Log - August 16th 2022 *** NEW ***</h2>
                <p>More C# code has been committed to GitHub for my synthesizer. I've moved onto testing a console-based C# synthesizer instead of a C# Windows Form application. That repository will be up soon. In other news, I've uploaded a tech demo of my Visualizer work in the Unity 3D Engine.</p>

                <h2>Developer's Log - August 8th 2022</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been reached out to by a friend from University about making a maze for students in a thesis study would play. I recalled working on maze generation algorithms last year and have decided to pull up that old code that can be found on github here: https://github.com/erinvasquez/InvisibleChairProjectHDRP. I'm attempting to fix the maze generation outside of a debug environment, but I've made fantastic progress re-simulating maze generation with the pathing algorihtms I had studied before. Images are uploaded and will be featured in the future in this very blog post. Otherwise, wait for a link to appear below to a gallery of some sorts.

                <p>
                    In the month since starting this quote unquote blog, I've been maintaining some new C# Synthesizer code. With a combination of examples already on the internet in various languages, and a bit of my own
                    musical knowledge, I've translated some C# Physics Engine code for a previous VR Synthesizer/Instrument into a C# Framework Windows Forms application. Pictures and videos of the project will be available soon. I'm extremely excited to see this project grow. It's a great combination of science and music.

                <h2>Developer's Log - July 6th 2022</h2>
                <p>My website is finally up and running again. I plan on adding more logs about my progress in the future. I've managed to save enough funds to run a budget Google Cloud Virtual Machine to run this website. Time to focus energy on sprucing up this website and exploring more C#, ASP.net, JavaScript audio synthesis, and Python machine learning.</p>
